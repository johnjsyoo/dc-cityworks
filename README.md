# Data Warehousing Project 
## John Yoo + Jorge Del Pino
A data warehousing project where we take a transactional database and transform it into a star schema.

All data is gathered from the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) dataset as a part of the Open Data DC initiative. The best way to run through the code is to fire up the iPython Notebook.  Enjoy!
